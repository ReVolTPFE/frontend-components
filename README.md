# frontend-components
Repository of frontend components I create with the models of https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## Projects
Most of components are created with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
They are all responsive.

Each component folder has a number according to the order in which the components were created.

Each component folder has images, assets and fonts because on frontendmentor.io, you can download a base folder for the component you will create.
