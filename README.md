# frontend-components
Repository of frontend components I create with the models of https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## Projects
Most of components are created with vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
They are all responsive.

Each component folder has a number according to the order in which the components were created.

Each component folder has images, assets and fonts because on frontendmentor.io, you can download a base folder for the component you will create.

The components will not always be 100% equal to the model, but they will be as close as possible.

## How to run
You only have to open the index.html file on a browser for each component folder.
